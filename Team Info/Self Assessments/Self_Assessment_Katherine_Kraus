My individual contributions to this project were in the research of the physical components of the prototype.
There was also the work on the presentation slides, user docs, test plan, etc. 
I was able to apply and build upon the skills identified in my initial assessment from last fall. 
But there were also new skills that were added. Some of the successes was a completed senior design project. 

  Some obstacles were that being computer science majors, the hardware was something that had to be extensively researched.
My main obstacle was that it was hard for us to meet in-person to work on the project, so all of our meetings were virtual. 
This also meant that we used digital collaboration spaces to work on things, which can get a little complicated. 
The skills I gained were related to these obstacles. Our team lead, Destry, really stood out in spearheading the physical aspect of the project. 
It was hard to know where to start with such a different environment than we were all used to, with the electrical components, and he stepped up.
